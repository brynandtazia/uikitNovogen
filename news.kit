<meta name="description" content="Bio-pharmaceutical company using breakthrough technology to create the CS-6 family of drugs to selectively kill cancer stem cells, without side effects.">
<meta name="keywords" content="Novogen owns two proprietary drug technology platforms that are first-in-class Both technologies target essential functions that lie at the heart of cells behaving abnormally. These essential functions are present across a wide range of degenerative diseases including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders and autoimmune diseases. Novogen believes exploiting them will revolutionize the treatment of many of the common diseases affecting our community and for which no curative treatments currently exist. The first of our technologies is a family of small molecules known as super- benzopyrans (SBPs). SBPs regulate the function of tissue stem cells. The second technology is our anti-tropomyosin (ATM) technology, targeting the micro-filament component of a cancer cell&#39;s cytoskeleton" />
