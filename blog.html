                <h4>An update on the Cantrixil Clinical Trial Program</h4>

                <p class="uk-article-meta">Written by Dr Graham Kelly on 1 December 2014.</p>


                <h4>Dear Shareholders,</h4>
                <p>A shareholder wrote to me recently talking about the need to be focused. That even if we had all the money we needed to run all the programs to their maximum capacity, that it would be a mistake to try and do so. It was sage advice and it very neatly summed up our current view of the world.</p>
                <p>Cantrixil is our focus. Bringing Cantrixil into the clinic, transforming the Company from pre-clinical to clinical stage, and generating clinical data that we hope will justify our confidence in the SBP technology, are our primary objectives.</p>
                <p>We are about half-way through a 10-month task list for making Cantrixil ‘clinic ready’. It’s a process that involves mainly learning how to make the drug on a large-scale basis and running animal toxicity studies so that we are prepared for what we might expect to see in the clinic. We know that the active ingredient in Cantrixil, TRXE-002, is toxic; that is a consequence of elevating the cytotoxic anti-cancer potency of the compound to the point of being able to kill the highly chemo-resistant cancer stem cells. But the good news is that we have achieved complete eradication of cancer in mice at dosages that cause only minimal toxicity.</p>
                <p>We are going to start the clinical trialing program in Australia because there are some significant savings in both money and time in starting the clinical process outside of the US. We still intend to file an IND in the US and to be in US clinics in the medium-term, but we will be starting in Australia.</p>
                <p>The recruitment of Australian clinical sites and investigators has commenced, with a target of 6 sites in mind. So many sites is unusual in a Phase 1 study, but we are doing it to expedite patient recruitment.</p>
                <p>The first-in-man study will be a little different from the usual Phase 1 study. Because Cantrixil is injected into the peritoneal cavity, we only will be recruiting patients with cancers involving the abdomen. And while this will provide the opportunity to look at the efficacy of Cantrixil on a range of different cancer types, the focus will be on patients with late-stage ovarian cancer.</p>
                <p>Patients will undergo a minor operation to have a catheter inserted in their abdomen to allow the Cantrixil to be injected up to 3-times weekly. The rationale is that the Cantrixil construct dissolves within the peritoneal cavity, releasing the active drug candidate, TRXE-002, which seeks out and kills the ovarian cancer stem cells and their daughter cells in tumors ranging from the microscopic up to large tumor masses.
                </p>
                <p>I will report more on this exciting program as we move closer to entering the clinic.</p>

                </h1>

                <p class="uk-article-meta">Written by Dr Graham Kelly on 24 November 2014.


                <h4>Dear Shareholders,</h4>
                <p>It’s been an eventful couple of months. Some of you might say, problematic, but I will stick with eventful.

                  I’ll divide my comments on this situation into what I regard as the three key elements of the current Novogen story.</p>

                <p>The first element concerns the structure of the Board, more particularly the reduction from 5 to 4 directors. It means that I will continue on with the joint roles of Executive Chairman and CEO for the time being. It was never so much a problem of workload as it was a corporate governance issue where shareholder interests are best represented by having an independent director in the chair. We will give ourselves all the time we need to find a suitable replacement for Iain Ross and someone who can assume the chairmanship.</p>
                <p>The second element is funding.  The $1.9M we raised recently was disappointingly below the minimum $5M we had hoped to raise. This was a process that started back in May with the appointment of a medium-sized US investment bank to manage the capital-raise. A tough US market for biotech stocks turned even tougher in September. And a micro market cap, pre-clinical stage, and foreign (ASX) stock, are all factors that didn’t help. Reverting to Australia at short notice and raising $1.9M at very short notice in the middle of the Medibank Private float, I actually regard as something of an achievement.</p>
                <p>Those funds, plus our existing cash reserves plus the forthcoming R&amp;D Tax Incentive Rebate have given us the breathing space we need to set about raising the required capital in a rational and measured way. That process has started and I hope to be able to report on its progress in the near future.</p>
                <h4>A few points in regard to funding:</h4>
                <p>(i) One is that we have put some long-needed planning into capital-raising, with an emphasis on bringing much of this effort in-house. This was how we did it in Novogen Mark 1 and we were very successful in raising in excess of $150M from US and European investment funds between 1998-2004.</p>
                <p>Non-Executive Director, John O’Connor, who played a key role in those raisings through his stockbroking experience, is re-assuming responsibility at Board level for this key task. I think we made a pretty effective team, so I look forward to resuming the battle with him.</p>
                <p>But more to the point, we have appointed a US-based Vice-President – Corporate Relations. Mr Robert Kennedy is domiciled in New York and has a history of investment banking in the US going back to 1987 and has been familiar with the Novogen story virtually since its inception. He will be working full-time for us in bringing the Novogen story to US investors. That appointment alone will take a considerable workload off my shoulders, as well as bringing a much-needed rationalization to the whole approach of conducting roadshows as part of capital-raising efforts.</p>
                <p>(ii) The second point is our Nasdaq listing. We are dedicated to maintaining this listing. We have approximately 2,500 US shareholders, a number we intend to build up. We will be submitting a plan to Nasdaq within the next several weeks that lays out the strategy to fund the Company through the next 2 years.</p>
                <p>
                  (iii) Third, and I think very critically, there is nothing like difficult market conditions to force a review of funding priorities. The Company has experienced extraordinary organic growth over the past 2 years with two drug technology platforms spawning a myriad of exciting clinical opportunities. We were never going to be able to treat each and every project as top priority, but recent events have been a timely trigger in forcing the discipline of ranking a lengthy pipeline of opportunities. Everything continues, just now with a sense of priority, with partnering opportunities presenting for some programs.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Finally to the third element - the Company’s inner strength – its science. This is the intrinsic value of the Company, as distinct from the market’s perceived value of the Company.
                </p>
                <h4>We have settled on four drug candidates:</h4>
                <p>Cantrixil – a novel product designed to be injected into the abdominal cavity where we hope to utilize its special ability to kill the full range of cancer cells, but particularly the cancer stem cells. We are only a matter of months away from having this product in the clinic in women with late-stage cancer and in men and women with a terminal condition known as malignant ascites associated with late-stage cancers of a variety of types.</p>
                <p>Trilexium – we believe this to be the first drug ever developed with a predilection for cancer cells of neural origin. It certainly is the first drug known to show potent killing of adult brain cancer (glioblastoma multiforme) stem cells and paediatric neural cancer (medulloblastoma, DIPG, neuroblastoma) cells. We plan to have this drug enter the clinic in late-2015/early-2016 in both adult and pediatric patients..</p>
                <p>Trx-7 – showing extraordinarily potent activity against prostate cancer cells that have become resistant to other standard drugs. This is an exciting opportunity that finally looks like bringing hope to one of our most pressing community health problems.</p>
                <p>ATM3507 – our recently identified anti-tropomyosin drug, a first-in-class drug with the capacity to make the most commonly used chemotherapy drugs (so-called anti-mitotics) work substantially better. The potential of this technology is seen with the example of prostate cancer. The anti-mitotic drug, docetaxel, is standard of care once the disease has metastasized, delivering a modest survival benefit of about 3 months. Using an ATM drug is used in combination with docetaxel in vitro results in the killing effect of docetaxel being vastly increased.</p>
                <p>I believe that these 4 drugs represent the future of chemotherapy.</p>
                <p>We’re getting on with the job with a re-energised Board and highly committed staff.  We have new strategies for both our R&amp;D programs and our continuing thirst for capital as we move 4 highly promising drugs into the clinic.</p>

                </h1>

                <h4>The AGM Dealt with 3 key matters</h4>
                <ul>
                <li>
                  the Company’s proposed clinical program over the next 12 months
                </li>
                <li>the Company’s funding situation</li>
                <li>some Board restructuring to meet the demands of the next 12 months.</li>
                </ul>
              <p>My Chairman’s Report touched formally on each of these matters, but later presentations to the meeting fleshed out the details, and that is my purpose here – to provide the detail that those of you not able to attend have missed out on.<br><br>I will do this in reverse order.<h3>Restructuring</h3>

              <p>The dual role of Executive Chairman and CEO was something that I saw as being necessary in the Company’s formative stages. But it wasn’t a workload that I could reasonably maintain as the Company grew, apart from not being ideal corporate governance. The time had come to separate the roles and that was my recommendation to the Board.</p>

              <p>A more slight change in Board duties was the appointment of Non-Executive Director, John O’Connor, to oversee fund-raising activities. This is a function that has occupied a large amount of my time this year, time that I can ill-afford as the Company moves this coming year into the clinic. John’s extensive experience in stockbroking in the UK, US and Australia makes him well-suited to this task.</p>
              <h3>Funding</h3>
              <p>It costs approximately $3.5M to fund a drug through the IND (pre-clinical) process and into a Phase 1 study. We set ourselves a target budget of $8M for calendar year 2015 in order to see Cantrixil come into the clinic and follow-up pipeline drug candidates, Trilexium and an ATM product, made ready for entry into the clinic.</p>
              <p>A minimum raising of $5M was set on that basis, with auxiliary funding opportunities including non- dilutive funding factored in.</p>
              <p>We managed to raise just on $1.9M. Despite it being a tough market, there is no getting away from the fact that this was a disappointing outcome. Nevertheless, this money in combination with our Tax Incentive rebate gives us the breathing space to continue with our programs while we bed down alternative funding avenues. The Board currently is considering a number of funding offers and expects to be reporting on these in the next 2-3 weeks along with an R&amp;D program commensurate with our cash position.</p>
              <h3>The Science</h3>
              <p>Tough market conditions cannot disguise the fact that the Company is uniquely positioned in the field of chemotherapy with its two drug technology platforms. One platform kills cancer stem cells, to an extent in animal models that suggests the very real prospect in humans of blocking tumor recurrence across a wide range of cancer types. The other platform dramatically increases the effectiveness of one of the most widely prescribed family of chemotherapy drugs in oncology.<br><br>
                Cantrixil opens up a wide range of therapeutic opportunities. The original concept was a drug that could be injected directly into the peritoneal cavity of patients with ovarian cancer where it would seek out and kill the cancer stem cells that spread the cancer within the abdomen, and that would work in combination with standard chemotherapy drugs such as carboplatin to destroy the full complement of cancer cells. It was developed with both early- and late-stage ovarian cancer indications in mind.<br><br>
                Late-stage ovarian cancer will be the starting point for a first-in-man study. This study will be run in both Australia and the US. A number of centres will be involved in order to expedite patient recruitment and will involve about 25 patients. Yale Cancer Center (New Haven, CT) is a confirmed site and we are in the process of recruiting three other sites. The aim is to commence enrolment in 2H15.<br><br>
                Cantrixil has proved highly successful in blocking both primary disease and recurrent disease in an animal model of ovarian cancer. In recurrent disease it has worked in animals with heavy tumor load (carcinomatosis) and extensive ascites (abdominal fluid collection). This suggested that Cantrixil might also be an appropriate treatment for patients with very advanced cancer within the abdomen associated with large build-up of fluid. The condition is called malignant ascites and is a common condition affecting a large proportion of patients with cancer of the ovary, uterus, stomach, large bowel, pancreas and breast, as well as lymphoma. That is a clinical indication that we are keen to pursue as soon as we have the necessary funding.<br><br>
                Dr Justine Stehn presented an update on the anti-tropomyosin (ATM) program. She explained that 8 months after the Company started its drug development program, it is within 2 weeks of identifying the lead ATM drug candidate. The process has been narrowed down to 5 compounds, all highly active, with the final selection process in its closing stages. The key required feature of the lead candidate being an ability to synergize the anti-cancer potency of the standard chemotherapy drug families - taxanes (paclitaxel, docetaxel) and vinca alkaloids (vincristine, vinblastine). The rationale is straightforward: joining the forces of an ATM drug and a taxane or vinca alkaloid, results in catastrophic destruction of the cancer cell’s cytoskeleton to a level many tens of times more potent that either drug alone. The key clinical indications that the lead candidate will be applied to are melanoma, prostate cancer and neuroblastoma.<br><br>
                With two important new families of cytotoxic chemotherapies, one of which is providing potent killing of cancer stem cells, Novogen believes it is uniquely is well-placed to make a difference to the survival prospects of many patients with cancer.<br><br>
                With prudent management and shareholder support, we plan on being in the clinic within the next 12 months and hopefully providing evidence of clinical response to justify our confidence in our science.</p>
              <h3>About Novogen Limited</h3>

              <p>Novogen is a public, Australian drug-development company whose shares trade on both the Australian Securities Exchange (‘NRT’) and NASDAQ (‘NVGN’). The Novogen Group includes a New Haven CT – based joint venture company, CanTx Inc, with Yale University.<br><br>
                Novogen has two main drug technology platforms: super-benzopyrans (SBPs) and anti-tropomyosins (ATMs). SBP compounds have been created to kill the full range of cells within a tumor, but particularly the cancer stem cells. The ATM compounds target the microfilament component of the cancer cell and when used in conjunction with standard anti-microtubular drugs, result in comprehensive and fatal destruction of the cancer cell’s cytoskeleton. Ovarian cancer, colorectal cancer, malignant ascites, prostate cancer, neural cancers (glioblastoma, neuroblastoma) and melanoma are the key clinical indications being pursued, with the ultimate objective of employing both technologies as a unified approach to first-line therapy.</p>
